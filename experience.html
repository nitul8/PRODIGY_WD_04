                            During my internship at Prodigy Infotech, I honed my
                            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to create visually
                            appealing web interfaces. It improved my HTML, CSS,
                            and JavaScript skills by 34 per cent.

                            Through daily stand-ups, code reviews, and regular
                            feedback sessions, I enhanced my ability to work
                            collaboratively towards achieving project goals and
                            meeting deadlines.

                            Throughout the internship, I encountered various
                            challenges and bugs in the development process,
                            which helped me develop strong problem-solving
                            skills.
