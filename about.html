                    As a student at Jorhat Engineering College's Computer
                    Science and Engineering department, I'm deeply engaged in
                    both theoretical learning and hands-on experimentation. My
                    passion for innovation and problem-solving fuels my
                    exploration of cutting-edge technologies, driving me to
                    contribute meaningfully to the field. With a solid
                    foundation in computer science, I'm excited about the
                    opportunities to make impactful strides in the dynamic and
                    ever-evolving tech industry. I'm honing my skills in HTML,
                    CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks. My goal is to
                    create user-friendly and visually appealing websites that
                    leverage the latest web technologies.
